description: Executing native payloads as unmanaged code on both linux and windows.
---


## We write a program to execute native payloads as unmanaged code on both linux and windows. (using metasploit)

- We integrate the previous program to run native windows payloads along with some libs and conditions for handling linux execution:
	> We added libraries from `libc` to execute os cmds on linux.

	> Added an `else-if` statement to check if its a linux system and execute payloads according to its architecture in the code block.
- _Note: If SeLinux is enabled it restricts RWX memory allocation. Try using Ubuntu._

### CODE:
